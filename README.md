# RayMarch
A repository for ray marching tutorials and code. Code is provided under an MIT license.

I received a grant for 5 weeks to teach two students the fundamentals of ray marching from the ground up. I challenged them to gather resources, watch videos, and find holes in those resources. Our goal was to produce tutorial content to then teach ray marching to other students in the future. They decided to make videos! This page lists links to the shaders we created as well as to other content that we deemed useful to pull these students up to speed. They had no math background or graphics knowledge before we began, so if they can do it - you can too!
