# RayMarch
A repository for ray marching tutorials and code. Code is provided under an MIT license.

I received a grant for 5 weeks to teach two students the fundamentals of ray marching from the ground up. I challenged them to gather resources, watch videos, and find holes in those resources. Our goal was to produce tutorial content to then teach ray marching to other students in the future. They decided to make videos! This page lists links to the shaders we created as well as to other content that we deemed useful to pull these students up to speed. They had no math background or graphics knowledge before we began, so if they can do it - you can too!

The video tutorial focuses on using shader toy to teach you the fundamentals. Because of that, I decided to use another resource to provide some variety. The resource I choose is https://glsl.app. When moving to writing your own fragment shaders in a standalone application, glsl.app will be just a tad closer. 

I wrote the following fragment shader by watching the student's first ray marching segment and adapting to my style. I tend to comment more than the students but I also tended towards using more common variable names. Your mileage may vary and my hope is that the combination of the resources is more beneficial than just one.

You can check out the first fragment shader [First Fragment Shader](first.frag).
